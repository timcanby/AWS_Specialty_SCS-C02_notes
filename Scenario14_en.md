#  AWS Organizations × Multi-Account Security Monitoring and Auto-Remediation Design Document

---

## 📘 Scenario

A company uses AWS Organizations and operates production workloads across multiple AWS accounts.  
A security engineer must design a centralized security monitoring system that:

- 🔍 **Proactively detects suspicious activity across all production accounts**
- ⚙️ **Automatically remediates incidents as they occur**
- 📩 **Sends notifications via Amazon SNS for critical security findings**
- 📁 **Centralizes all security logs in a dedicated logging account**

---

## 🧠 Design Requirements and Key Considerations

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| ✅ Multi-account support | Centralized management and integration with AWS Organizations |
| ✅ Central log aggregation | Collect all security data into a dedicated logging account |
| ✅ Auto-remediation | Use Lambda or Systems Manager to handle incidents |
| ✅ Notifications for critical findings | Immediate alerting using SNS |
| ✅ Scalability | Flexible structure that accommodates new accounts and evolving rules |

---

## ✅ Recommended Architecture

### **D. AWS Security Hub + EventBridge + Lambda + SNS**

| Component | Role |
|-----------|------|
| 🔒 **Security Hub** | Enable in each production account for centralized detection and compliance checks |
| 🔁 **Aggregation in central account** | Consolidate Security Hub findings into a single logging account |
| ⚡ **EventBridge + Lambda** | Use EventBridge rules to trigger Lambda functions for remediation |
| 🔔 **SNS Notifications** | Lambda sends alerts to SNS topics for critical events |

---

## 🔍 Limitations of GuardDuty Alone

While Amazon GuardDuty is a powerful service for real-time threat detection, **it has several limitations**, and by itself may not provide complete security coverage.

### ❗ Common Blind Spots of GuardDuty

| Area | Limitation |
|------|------------|
| IAM misconfigurations | Cannot detect overly permissive or misconfigured IAM policies |
| Public S3 settings | Will not alert if S3 buckets are public unless combined with Config or Security Hub |
| OS-level threats | Cannot detect processes or login anomalies inside EC2 instances (Inspector or CW Logs required) |
| Long-term behavioral drift | Good for real-time events, but not for gradual policy or behavioral drift (Security Hub or AWS Config helps) |
| Application layer attacks | Cannot detect HTTP-based application vulnerabilities (needs WAF or Inspector Advanced) |

---

## 🧭 Why Security Hub is Essential

Security Hub complements and extends GuardDuty with:

- ✅ **Security Best Practices scoring (CIS, PCI, etc.)**
- ✅ **Configuration risk detection for S3, IAM, VPC, EBS, etc.**
- ✅ **Integration with AWS Config, Inspector, Macie, and more**
- ✅ **Centralized high-severity findings view and EventBridge actions**

---

## ✅ Final Architecture Recommendation

To maximize security visibility and response across multiple accounts:

- Enable **GuardDuty** in each account for real-time behavioral detection
- Enable **Security Hub** in each account for compliance checks and findings aggregation
- Use **EventBridge** to route findings to **Lambda** for remediation
- Use **SNS** for critical alert notifications
- Send all findings to a **central security logging account**

This architecture provides a **holistic, automated, and scalable security monitoring solution for AWS multi-account environments**.
