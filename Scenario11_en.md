#  AWS Security Hub Critical Finding Email Notification Design Document

---

## ðŸ“˜ Scenario

A company wants to receive **email notifications when AWS Security Hub detects a "CRITICAL" finding**.  
The company currently has no infrastructure to support this function.

---

## ðŸ§  Key Points

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| âœ… Security Hub integrates with EventBridge | Security Hub can send findings to EventBridge in near real time |
| âœ… SNS is ideal for email notification | Amazon SNS can directly send emails to subscribed endpoints |
| âœ… Simplicity matters | The goal is just to send an email, so avoid complex architectures |

---

## âœ… Best Architecture (Correct Answer)

### C. Use an EventBridge rule to filter for critical findings and send to SNS for email delivery

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| â‘  | Create an EventBridge rule to filter findings with `SeverityLabel = "CRITICAL"` |
| â‘¡ | Set Amazon SNS topic as the rule's target |
| â‘¢ | Subscribe an email address to the SNS topic |
| â‘£ | Confirm the subscription via email to begin receiving alerts |

---

### ðŸŽ¯ Example EventBridge Rule Pattern:

```json
{
  "source": ["aws.securityhub"],
  "detail-type": ["Security Hub Findings - Imported"],
  "detail": {
    "findings": {
      "Severity": {
        "Label": ["CRITICAL"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ðŸš« Issues With Other Options

| Option | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| A. Lambda â†’ SNS | Overcomplicated â€” EventBridge can directly call SNS |
| B. Kinesis Data Firehose | Intended for log delivery, not email notifications |
| D. Amazon SES | Requires domain validation and setup, overkill for this case; SNS is simpler and faster |

---

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

- âœ… The most practical and simplest architecture is:  
  **EventBridge rule (filtering CRITICAL) â†’ SNS topic â†’ Email**
- âœ… No code or infrastructure setup required beyond native AWS service configuration
